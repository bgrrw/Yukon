1,Aishihik Lake,"Aishihik is a misspelling of the Southern Tutchone word Äshèyi, which refers to the village site “at the head of the lake, base of the mountains, where the ranges meet.” The lake is also called Män Shäw* for “big lake.” The Aishihik bison herd was re-introduced to this area in the 1980s.
